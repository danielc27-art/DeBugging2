# DeBugging2

This repository is intended for you to practice debugging skills.  There are several errors across this flask site for you to find, and debug.  

# Setup & Installation

As we did before with our flask website, we will need to create a virtual environment, activate that environment, and install flask before running the website. See the steps below:  

Open the site in a new Visual Studio window
Open the terminal and type the following to set up a virtual environment: 
>`python3 -m venv .venv`

You should now have a .venv folder in your project. 

In your terminal prompt lets activate the virtual environment: 
>`. .venv/bin/activate`

and now lets install flask, so we can run our site: 
>`pip install flask`

Because we are using the OpenAI API, and an environment variable in this repo, we should install openai, and dotenv. The line below should do both at once.  

>`pip install openai dotenv`

Copy 
Now try running the site by having Visual Studio run your app.py file.
